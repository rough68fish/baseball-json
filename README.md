### Baseball JSON Schema

This repository contains a JSON schema for representing pitch-by-pitch and play-by-play events in baseball games.

To validate an instance document using [ajv](https://epoberezkin.github.io/ajv/):

```
$ ajv -s schema/baseball-schema-1.0.0.json -d examples/NYA201508040.json
examples/NYA201508040.json valid
$
```

The schema validates the following structure.  Much of this structure is borrowed from the [Project Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org) [Event File](http://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm) format.
